A user is taken through a series of multiple choice questions and being assessed based on the options chosen.
-Create a JSON structure to iterate through the questions. Set a score for each options (1, 2, 3 etc)
-User can navigate back and forth and can change their choices (see visuals within folder screenshots)
-There is only single route for all questions (/assessment)
-On the last page display final score (no visuals provided)

Use create-react-app to boilerplate app code (npm install -g create-react-app)
